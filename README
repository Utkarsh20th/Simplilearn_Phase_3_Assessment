   - The Collection will be imported in the POSTMAN application. Expand the Collection to see GET and POST requests
     Note: GET operation is done to fetch list of users from Reqres.in API
           POST operation is done to add a user into Reqres.in API
   - Necessary Environment variables are located at location .\Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment\POSTMAN\1_Script\Environment\Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment_Environment.postman_environment.json
   GET
   * Click on "GET_(List_of_users)" and then click on "Send". The API response and the result of reponse validation will be seen in  "Response-Body" tab and "Test Results" tab respectively
   * Result is also stored at location .\Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment\POSTMAN\2_Result\GET_Response.json
   * Screenshots of the execution and results are present at location .\Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment\POSTMAN\3_Screenshots\GET
   POST
   * Click on "POST_(Add_a_user)" and then click on "Send". The API response and the result of reponse validation will be seen in  "Response-Body" tab and "Test Results" tab respectively
   * Result is also stored at location .\Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment\POSTMAN\2_Result\POST_Response.json
   * Screenshots of the execution and results are present at location .\Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment\POSTMAN\3_Screenshots\POST
   
6: Third folder will be of RESTAssured project
   - COPY the Maven project present at location .\Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment\RESTAssured\1_Maven_Script\Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment and PASTE it in the Eclipse workspace
   - In "Package Explorer" tab of Eclipse, project name "Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment" will be seen as a directory folder, right-click the folder and select Maven-->Update Project...
   GET
   * double-click the java code (.java) file present in the directory at location Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment\src\test\java\Project\Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment\GET_list_of_users.java
   * select Run As --> 1 TestNG Test
   * the (output + log) messages will be seen in console
   POST
   * double-click the java code (.java) file present in the directory at location Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment\src\test\java\Project\Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment\POST_adding_a_user.java
   * select Run As --> 1 TestNG Test
   * the (output + log) messages will be seen in console
   - after the execution, right-click the project folder "Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment" and click "Referesh", the latest execution reports will be generated at the location Simplilearn_Phase_3_Assessment\test-output
